Application Isolation
=====================

Applications SHALL not run as root.

Platform implementations MUST provide:

- a shared base image

  - a hardened base image
- application image support

Networking
----------

Applications MUST be denied direct network access by default.

- /tmp

  - MUST be limited in size as described in the deployment manifest

Applications may use another library, otherwise they must bring their own.

Platform implementations MUST retain application state and SHALL NOT discard it
before a requested reset.
