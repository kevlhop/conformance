# GEISA Conformance - a GEISA validation framework

GEISA conformance is designed to help developers to validate the conformance
with the [GEISA Specification](https://github.com/geisa/specification).

The GEISA Specification is an effort by the Grid Edge Interoperability and Security Alliance to define a consistent, secure, and interoperable computing environment for embedded devices at the very edge of the electric utility grid, like electric meters and distribution automation devices, for the benefit of utilities, platform vendors, and software vendors.  If you would like to get involved, please head over to our Wiki page for details on participation (https://lfenergy.org/projects/geisa/).  Follow the onboarding link for details about participating in our community process.

A docker support is also available to launch the tests with a container, it requires:
  - cqfd (See [requirements](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) and [installation](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd?tab=readme-ov-file#installingremoving-cqfd) steps on github)
  - qemu-user-static to build the container for cross-compilation (On ubuntu, install with `sudo apt install qemu-user-static`)

#### Launch tests

A script is provided to launch all tests automatically. This script will execute
the tests and create a report.

``./launch_conformance_tests.sh [options]``

Required options:

* `--ip <board_ip>`: IP address of the board to test
or
* `--serial <serial_port>`: Serial port of the board to test

:Warning: When using serial, do not use another tool to access the serial port
while running the tests, as it may interfere with the tests and cause unexpected
results.

Optional options:

* `--user <username>`: The username for the target device (default: root)
* `--password <password>`: The password for the target device (default: empty)
* `--no-reports` : Do not generate test reports (only run tests and display results)
* `--baudrate <baudrate>`: The baudrate for the serial port of the board (default: 115200)
* `--no-glee-tests`: Do not run GEISA Linux Execution Environment Conformance tests
* `--no-gadm-tests`: Do not run GEISA Application & Device Management Conformance tests
* `--no-gapi-tests`: Do not run GEISA Application Programming Interface Conformance tests
* `--help`: display help message

GADM test options (optional):
* `--host-ip <host_ip>`: IP address of the host running the EMS server
* `--api-endpoint <endpoint>`: EMS API endpoint (default: <server-url>/api)
* `--client-name <name>`: ADM client endpoint name (default: geisa_adm_client)
* `--client-path <path>`: Path to ADM client binary on the board (default: /usr/bin/adm_client)
* `--client-psk-identity <id>`: PSK identity for the ADM client (default: <client-name>)
* `--client-psk-value <value>`: PSK secret for the ADM client (default: auto-generated hex string of length 16)
* `--client-params <params>`: Parameters to start the ADM client (use case: <client-path> <client-params>)
* `--package-path <path>`: Path to the ADM package to test (a squashfs file containing the client binary for the current implementation)
* `--server-url <url>`: EMS server URL (default: http://localhost:8080)

Environment variables can also be used to configure the script:
* `CONFORMACE_SCP_ARGS`: Additional arguments for the `scp` command
* `CONFORMACE_SSH_ARGS`: Additional arguments for the `ssh` command
* `GLEE_TESTS`: Specify the list of GEISA LEE tests name to run (default: all tests)
The tests names correspond to a part of the filename.
Example: `GLEE_TESTS="os_requirements_tests application_isolation"` will run only the `os_requirements_tests` and `application_isolation` tests.

A xml and pdf report will be generated in the `reports` directory.

For ADM tests, if your software package is outside the project directory, you may want to mount its directory in the container by setting the `CQFD_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS` environment variable before running tests. For example:

```bash
export CQFD_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS="-v path/to/package:path/to/package"
```

To use the docker support run with the following commands:
```bash
$ cqfd init
$ cqfd run ./launch_conformance_tests.sh --ip <board_ip> [options]
or
$ cqfd run ./launch_conformance_tests.sh --serial <serial_port> [options]
```

Launching the tests with the ip option, will run the bandwidth test.

### Launch tests manually

#### Requirements

The manual launch is requiring some dependencies to generate the report on the host:
* python3 (On ubuntu, install with `sudo apt install python3`)
* python3-junitparser (On ubuntu, install with `sudo apt install python3-junitparser`)
* asciidoctor-pdf (On ubuntu, install with `sudo apt install ruby-asciidoctor-pdf`)

A docker support is also available to generate the report on the host, it requires:
* cqfd (See [requirements](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) and [installation](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/cqfd?tab=readme-ov-file#installingremoving-cqfd) steps on github)

For the tests to run, you need to have the following requirements on the target:
- iperf3 for the bandwidth test (iperf3 should also be installed on the host)

#### Launch tests

If you want to launch the tests manually, you can transfer the tests (src/GEISA-LEE-tests) and the orchestrator (src/cukinia) folders to /tmp/conformance_tests folder on the target.

Then on the target, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
$ /tmp/conformance_tests/cukinia/cukinia -f junitxml -o geisa-lee-conformance-report.xml /tmp/conformance_tests/GEISA-LEE-tests/cukinia.conf
```
This will generate a `geisa-lee-conformance-report.xml` file in the current directory. This file will be used to generated the PDF report.
If you only want to run the tests without generating the report, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ /tmp/conformance_tests/cukinia/cukinia /tmp/conformance_tests/GEISA-LEE-tests/cukinia.conf
```

A special case is done for the bandwidth test, as it requires a server to run the test. You can run the following command to launch the tests and generate the report:
```bash
$ /tmp/conformance_tests/cukinia/cukinia -f junitxml -o geisa-lee-conformance-report-bandwidth.xml /tmp/conformance_tests/GEISA-LEE-tests/connectivity_tests_bandwidth.conf
```
or without the report generation:
```bash
$ /tmp/conformance_tests/cukinia/cukinia /tmp/conformance_tests/GEISA-LEE-tests/connectivity_tests_bandwidth.conf
```

Then on your host you can run the iperf3 client:
```bash
$ iperf3 -c <board_ip>
```

#### Generate report

To generate the PDF report, transfer the xml report (and the bandwidth report if generated) on your host in test-report-pdf folder (/path/to/conformance/src/test-report-pdf) and generate it with the following commands:

```bash
cd /path/to/conformance/src/test-report-pdf
./compile.py -i . -p 'GEISA conformance tests' -d ../pdf_themes -c ../GEISA-LEE-tests/GEISA-LEE-matrix.csv --allow_absent
```

This will generate a PDF report in the current directory named `test-report.pdf`.

or you can use the docker support to generate the report on the host with the following commands:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/conformance/
$ cqfd init
$ cqfd run "cd src/test-report-pdf && ./compile.py -i . -p 'GEISA conformance tests' -d ../pdf_themes -c ../GEISA-LEE-tests/GEISA-LEE-matrix.csv --allow_absent"
```

This will generate a PDF report in the test-report-pdf directory named `test-report.pdf`.


## Configuration file

A configuration file is provided to set some test checks as the specification are not yet finalized.
The configuration file is located in `src/GEISA-LEE-tests/tests_configuration.conf`.

Here are the available configuration options:
* CONFIGURATION_FILE: Used to test the proper functioning of the configuration file.

## Installation

Download the repository and run the following command to download the
dependencies:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Testing

$ rm -rf src/GEISA-API-tests/src/build
```

## CI

The CI is configured to run static tests (shellcheck, pylint, black, clang-format,
clang-tidy) and on target tests on each push.

If you want to add a new target in the CI, add your runner in github settings
with a label corresponding to the target and modify
.github/workflows/ci-conformance-on-target.yml:

* To add ssh tests add the following code snippet in the `jobs` section:
```
on-target-tests-ssh-<target_name>:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/ci-conformance-on-target-ssh.yml
    with:
        runner: <target_name>
        user: <target_user>
    secrets:
        target_ip: ${{ secrets.<target_ip_secret> }}
        target_password: ${{ secrets.<target_ip_password> }}
    needs:
        - on-target-tests-approval
```
with :
* `<target_name>` being the name of your target (corresponding to the label
you configured).
* `<target_user>` being the user to connect to the target (optional, default: root).
* `<target_ip_secret>` being the name of the secret containing the IP address
of your target.
* `<target_ip_password>` being the name of the secret containing the password
of your target. (optional, if not provided, no password will be used for the SSH connection)

* To add serial tests add the following code snippet in the `jobs` section:
```
on-target-tests-serial-<target_name>:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/ci-conformance-on-target-serial.yml
    with:
        runner: <target_name>
        user: <target_user>
        target_tty: <target_tty>
        target_baudrate: <target_baudrate>
    secrets:
        target_password: ${{ secrets.<target_ip_password> }}
    needs:
        - on-target-tests-approval
        - on-target-tests-ssh-<target_name>
```
with :
* `<target_name>` being the name of your target (corresponding to the label
you configured).
* `<target_user>` being the user to connect to the target (optional, default: root).
* `<target_tty>` being the serial port of your target (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0).
* `<target_baudrate>` being the baudrate of your target (optional, default: 115200)
* `<target_ip_password>` being the name of the secret containing the password
of your target. (optional, if not provided, no password will be used for the serial connection)

### On-target tests approval

For security reasons, the on-target tests are not automatically executed on each
push. A manual approval by a maintainer is required to run the tests.
Exception is made for main branch, where the tests are automatically executed on
each push.

## API Launching script

When executing the API tests using ssh, the `launch_gapi_test_app.sh` script is
required to launch the test application on the target. This script is
responsible for setting up the environment and executing the test application.
Its goal is to provide a generic way to launch the test application on different
targets and with different configurations.
A template is available in `launch_gapi_test_app.sh.template`
